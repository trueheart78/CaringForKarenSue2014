    In 2009, our mom, Karen Danielson, was diagnosed with Stage 3B Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC). IBC is not detectable in mammograms, so usually by the time it is diagnosed, as with our mom, it has already spread. She fought long and hard, never giving up faith, never giving up hope. We originally started the golf tournament to support alternative treatments outside of the country for our mother.  Unfortunately, she lost her battle with cancer in September 2011.

    We made a promise to her that we would run the tournament no matter what happened for as long as we could to support a cause close to her heart. This is our fifth year and we are hoping that it’s our biggest.

    Mom was an unbelievably loving and caring woman. Always there to lend a hand, flash a smile, say the right words, or just give you a warm hug. She always knew what to do and when to do it.  Our parents were foster parents and our mom had a strong passion to help kids less fortunate. We are very proud, and honored to have a partnership with the Shiloh House in which all the funds we raise go to.

    The Shiloh House is a 501 (C) (3) that offers both residential and non-residential treatment for the treatment of male and female youth. They are greatly involved in foster care and they also give back and help the community.
